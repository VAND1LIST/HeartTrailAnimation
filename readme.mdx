# ❤️ Heart Trail Animation

A fun, interactive webpage that generates floating heart icons wherever the user moves the mouse. Each heart appears at the cursor, grows/shrinks randomly, floats upward with a colorful hue rotation, and disappears after a few seconds.

---

## ✨ Features

- Follows the **mouse movement** to create heart icons dynamically
- Randomized **size** for each heart (0px – 100px)
- **Animated floating effect**: hearts rise upward and fade out
- **Colorful effect** using `hue-rotate` CSS filter
- **Auto-removal** after 3 seconds to keep the DOM clean
- Fully **responsive** and lightweight

## 🎨 Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – Page structure
* **CSS3** – Styling, animations, and effects
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)** – Dynamic creation of heart elements and mouse tracking

---

## ⚡ Customization

* Change the **heart image** by editing the `background` property in `style.css`:

```css
span {
  background: url("HeartTrailAnimation.JPG");
}
```

* Adjust **animation speed or distance** in the `@keyframes animate`:

```css
@keyframes animate {
  0% { transform: translate(-50%, -50%); opacity: 1; filter: hue-rotate(0); }
  100% { transform: translate(-50%, -5000%); opacity: 0; filter: hue-rotate(720deg); }
}
```

* Change **heart lifespan** by modifying the `setTimeout` in `script.js`:

```
setTimeout(() => {
  spanEl.remove();
}, 3000); // 3000ms = 3 seconds
```

---

## 📌 Roadmap / Improvements

* [ ] Add **multiple heart shapes or icons**
* [ ] Adjust **animation speed based on cursor velocity**
* [ ] Add **trail effects like sparkles or particles**
* [ ] Add **mobile touch support**
